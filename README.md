The Abbott Business Traveller Guide, will give Visitors immediate access to information and map location of all our Abbott Sites Accross the Globe.  

Abbott Laboratories is an American multinational medical devices and health care company with headquarters in Abbott Park, Illinois, United States. The company was founded by Chicago physician Wallace Calvin Abbott in 1888.  Today, it sells medical devices, diagnostics, branded generic medicines and nutritional products.

Abbott has over 160 office locations across 77 countries.  Employing over 100,00 people around the world.

Business Travel frequency will depend on the employees position in the company.  It is highly probable that most employee will experience business travel as an Abbott Employee at some stage in their Abbott career e.g. when working on large projects across multiple sites, Training Courses etc.

The 'Abbott Business Traveller Guide' will be a valuable resource to all employees that will provide an information bank on Abbott Site & locations.  For example you are with the Company 2 years, your Manager informs you of an opportinity to join a project that will involve a visit to Japan.  The Guide will provide you with site information as well as Hotels, Restaurants etc in the area  

The 'Contact Us' link will provide users an opportunity to provide feedback and suggestions.

It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for employees.



## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### Visitor Goals

        1. As Visitor, I want to find the Abbot site I am visiting and learn more about the site e.g. is it Manufacturing, Commercial etc
        2. As Visitor, I want to easily find out more about the area I am visiting e.g What Hotels, Restaurants and Attractions are in the vicinity
        3. As Visitor, I want to be able to look for information from the Team managaging the Portal
        
-   ### Structure
    -   #### Multi Image Carousal
         -  By mousing over the Site Image the User instantly is shown the site information and location on map.  The User can then move on to the next location and new details are loaded
           -   The multi image carousal improves the user experience as it allow the user to view site information and location on map without scrolling down.
       -   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   Color is fundamental in the way we express the Abbott brand. The color palette I used includes, Dark in the header and light in the footer of each page.  The                   vibrant images in the Abbott Site carousal blend well with the background image.

    -   #### Typography.
        -   The 'Josefin Sans' font is the main font used throughout the whole website with sans-serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. The 'Josefin Sans'gives the Site an unified appearance throughtout. 
    -   #### Imagery 
        -   I selected vibrant images for each Site in the carousal that work well with the background image.
